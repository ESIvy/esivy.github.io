<meta name="description" content="In second grade, readers can really take off. Or not. Don&#39;t be worried if your child hasn&#39;t turned into a reader yet. Just focus on making fun books available. If you don&#39;t read kids&#39; books for your own entertainment (I do!) you might have trouble coming up with some suggestions for your son. But better than my suggestions, are the suggestions of another boy. Here are 8 of the best books for boys, my son&#39;s favorite books in second grade. This post contains affiliate links, at no cost to you. Thanks for supporting this blog in this way! Best Books For Boys in Second Grade - my son&#39;s favorite books The Adventures of Commander Zack Proton and the Red Giant by Brian Anderson (trilogy) - The zany space adventures of a boy astronaut and the space chimp who rescues him after he opens the wrong door and tumbles out of his spaceship. Lots of funny illustrations in an early chapter book. Secret Agent Jack Stalwart by Elizabeth Singer Hunt, An early chapter book, with fast chapters, that&#39;s a fun mystery spy series with lots of illustrations. Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson - A&nbsp;comic about a boy and his stuffed tiger that comes to life in his imagination. Together they have all sorts of adventures and get into all kinds of trouble. Foxtrot by Bill Amend - Finds the humor in the every day family life, mostly through the eyes of 10-year-old Jason who creates fun with the help of his computer and pet iguana. Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures by Haden Blackman - Graphic novels based on the Cartoon Network&#39;s Clone Wars, the Star Wars stories from the earlier history of that universe. The Secrets of Droon by Tony Abbott - Eric&nbsp;and his friends find a magical door in his basement that lead down rainbow stairs to Droon and they help save the kingdom. Cool Stuff and How It Works by Chris Woodford - How the tech around us works, from microchips to robots. Lots of photo illustrations. The Magician&#39;s Nephew (The Chronicles of Narnia) by C. S. Lewis - A stand-alone novel, the prequel to the Chronicles of Narnia. The lion, Aslan, creates Narnia to save two kids from an evil sorceress. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone, by J.K. Rowling - A boy finds out he&#39;s a wizard, and goes to wizarding school. This one is very advanced for a list of books for first grade, but my son read this the summer between 1st and 2nd grade and loved it! You never can tell what will catch their fancy enough for them to want to struggle through. Readers&#39; interests and ability are varied. Be sure to check out all my other lists of my kids&#39; favorite books, particularly my Best Books for Girls in 2nd Grade and Best Books for Boys in 1st Grade." />
