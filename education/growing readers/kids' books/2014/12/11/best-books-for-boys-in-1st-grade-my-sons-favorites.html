<meta name="description" content="In first grade, kids are just getting started with independent reading. I strongly believe that reading enjoyment is important, especially for early readers.&nbsp;If you don&#39;t read kids&#39; books for your own entertainment (I do!) you might have trouble coming up with some suggestions for your kids. But better than my suggestions, are the suggestions of another kid. Here are 4 of the best books for boys, my son&#39;s favorite books in first grade.

Best Books for Boys - My Son&#39;s Favorite Books in 1st Grade Garfield, by Jim Davis - Cartoon books are great for beginning readers, especially boys. Garfield is a classic that my son found really funny. (Read about my son&#39;s love for the fat cat in my post&nbsp;Growing Readers - helping your kids become readers.) Adam Sharp, by George Edward Stanley - (series) Books with lots of colorful pictures about an 8-year old spy who looks sharp and is plenty smart. Magic Treehouse, by Mary Pope Osborne (series) - An easy to read chapter book series about a boy, a girl, and the journeys they take in their magical treehouse. Magic Treehouse Research Guides by Mary Pope Osborne and Natlie Pope Boyce - These go along with the Magic Treehouse series and supplement the information about all sorts of interesting subjects. Readers&#39; interests and ability are varied. So be sure to check out all my other lists of my kids&#39; favorite books, particularly my Best Books for Girls in 1st Grade and Best Books for Boys in 2nd Grade." />
