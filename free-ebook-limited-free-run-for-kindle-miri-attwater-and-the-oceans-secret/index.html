<meta name="description" content="Is a Kindle going to be in your child&#39;s stocking? It&#39;s never too soon to start adding free ebooks to your account so they&#39;ll have lots of cool stuff to read right away. (And an added bonus, right now if you buy Amazon Prime when you buy your Kindle Paperwhite you get $40 off!) Trip to Grandmother&#39;s house? Keep them busy reading on the long trip&nbsp;over the river and through the woods. For a limited time, the Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#39;s Secret ebook edition is free on Kindle! This new ebook kindle edition has been restructured to match the chapter structure of book 2, Miri Attwater and All that Glitters, but it&#39;s still the same great story. It will match the print edition of Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#39;s Secret. Amazon no longer makes updated versions available to previous purchasers, but you can do so during this free promotion. If you already have Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#39;s Secret, I&#39;m not sure if it will load along-side the original copy or if it will replace it. If it replaces it, please note that you will lose your notes and reading location in the book. This free fun through Kindle is only 5 days, so don&#39;t miss picking up your free copy of Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#39;s Secret!
