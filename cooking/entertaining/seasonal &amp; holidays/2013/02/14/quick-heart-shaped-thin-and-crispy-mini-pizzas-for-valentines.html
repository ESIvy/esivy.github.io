<meta name="description" content="Looking for a last minute Valentine&#39;s Day snack or even a light but festive meal? Here&#39;s a recipe for quick heart-shaped thin and crispy mini-pizzas. You make the crust out of flour tortillas so you won&#39;t even have to mix the dough! Heart-Shaped Thin and Crispy Mini-Pizzas Recipe You will need: Flour tortillas Marinara sauce (or one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce + &amp;frac12; teaspoon Italian Seasoning) Shredded mozzarella, Monterrey jack, or provolone cheese Olive Oil Directions: 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 2. Cut each flour tortilla into a heart shape. (I used a large cookie cutter.) Brush both sides with olive oil. 3. Bake on a cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 6-8 minutes, or until very lightly browned. 4. Remove the tortillas from the oven. Flip the tortillas over. Top each with tomato sauce and then shredded mozzarella cheese. Put them back in the oven and bake until the cheese is melted, about 4 minutes. 5. Remove to racks or paper towels to cool. Serve warm. (Note: the amount of olive oil, marinara sauce, and cheese you will need per heart depends on the size of your cookie cutter. Hearts this size took about 2 teaspoons of marinara sauce and 1 tablespoon of shredded cheese each. I would estimate six hearts would take approximately 1 Tablespoon of olive oil.)

<h1>Heart-Shaped Thin and Crispy Mini-Pizzas Recipe</h1>
<h2>You will need:</h2>
<p>Flour tortillas<br />
Marinara sauce (or one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce + &frac12; teaspoon Italian Seasoning)<br />
Shredded mozzarella, Monterrey jack, or provolone cheese<br />
Olive Oil</p>
<h2>Directions:</h2>
<p>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.<br />
2. Cut each flour tortilla into a heart shape. (I used a large cookie<br />
cutter.) Brush both sides with olive oil.<br />
3. Bake on a cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 6-8 minutes, or until<br />
very lightly browned.<br />
4. Remove the tortillas from the oven. Flip the tortillas over. Top<br />
each with tomato sauce and then shredded mozzarella cheese. Put them<br />
back in the oven and bake until the cheese is melted, about 4 minutes.<br />
5. Remove to racks or paper towels to cool. Serve warm.</p>
<p>(Note: the amount of olive oil, marinara sauce, and cheese you will<br />
need per heart depends on the size of your cookie cutter. Hearts this<br />
size took about 2 teaspoons of marinara sauce and 1 tablespoon of<br />
shredded cheese each. I would estimate six hearts would take<br />
approximately 1 Tablespoon of olive oil.)</p>
