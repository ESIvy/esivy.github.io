<meta name="description" content="As I mention in last weeks post about fish cleaning stations, I didn&#39;t intend to do any research for the Miri Attwater series. So when I did start doing some research, I wasn&#39;t doing it like I would if I had been writing a non-fiction book about marine biology. I wasn&#39;t taking a lot of detailed notes with page numbers and cross-referencing. I wasn&#39;t double checking to see if information I got in one source could be confirmed by other sources. I wasn&#39;t looking at a lot of original sources - meaning I wasn&#39;t reading scientific research articles in marine biology journals. Because I know from my text book writing and editing work that there is lots of misinformation in science books and text books, and it gets copied when writers don&#39;t go back to original sources. Writing a really well researched science book takes time - a lot of it. And it helps if you&#39;re an expert in the field. Really, my first goal for my research was to look at pretty pictures so I could make the underwater scenes in the book more real to the reader. I probably shouldn&#39;t have been surprised that the more I saw, the more amazed I became by the diversity of marine life. But I still wanted to write a fantasy, not a nonfiction informational book. So I didn&#39;t keep detailed lists and notes of all the information I came across. I felt like if I did that kind of in-depth research and note taking, then I would start to develop a list of things that I wanted to include in the book. Then all the information would be in danger of taking over from the story. I wanted the story to be most important. [caption id=&quot;attachment_1887&quot; align=&quot;alignleft&quot; width=&quot;512&quot;] A potato cod is cleaned by two striped cleaner wrasse, By Richard Ling, via Wikimedia Commons[/caption] There were some subjects that I ended up reading in depth on both in books and on the web. Others things I thought were interesting, but I didn&#39;t know immediately when I saw them that I would use them in the story. They just became some of my general background knowledge that I had about life in the ocean. The fish cleaning stations in the scene in Miri Attwater and all That Glitters&nbsp;were one of those. I don&#39;t know quite when it occurred to me that it would make a fun scene. It wasn&#39;t until I was reviewing videos for this series of posts that I realized something.&nbsp;In all the videos I was viewing, yellow tangs and other cleaner fish were eating algae off the backs of turtles. Wrasse were the cleaner fish cleaning sharks and rays, and lots of other fish - including yellow tangs. And when I viewed videos with commentary, they mentioned that wrasse were eating dead skin and parasites. They didn&#39;t say anything about wrasse eating algae. While I have both tangs and wrasse in the cleaning station scene, I have Miri and Fisk having the algae cleaned off them by wrasse. Oops! Did I make a mistake? Information about fish cleaning stations isn&#39;t easy to find. I think perhaps it&#39;s one of those areas of science that&#39;s an emerging area of research. Maybe because as Howard Hall, and IMAX photographer, mentions in his notes while filming his latest movie, cleaner fish and cleaning can be disturbed by divers. I did find a bunch of mentions on aquarium boards that people talked about their wrasse eating algae, but I still wasn&#39;t sure. I got really excited when I finally found this website: Cleaner Fish do Clean by Coral Reef Ecology Laboratory.&nbsp;Now I could satisfy the only definitive way to be sure of an answer in science - ask an expert! I contacted Dr. Lex Grutter, and she was kind enough to answer me back. Sure enough, biologists consider wrasse carnivores, which means for a wrasse to clean Miri she would probably have to have a cut or be infected by parasites. Ooh, yuck! It&#39;s a pretty minor detail. Most readers are likely to only remember that Miri was cleaned by fish at a cleaning station and learn a little tiny bit more about the wondrous life under the ocean. And since some people have reported their aquarium wrasse eating algae, I could have satisfied the question by saying that the wrasse in Kai Kaona might act a little bit different. I do describe all the marine life in Kai Kaona as being transplanted from all over the world, like in our gardens and zoos. But, I like to be as accurate as possible. So I tweaked the scene by having the cleaner fish that tickle Miri while they&#39;re eating algae be yellow tangs instead. I&#39;ll post the corrected excerpt on next week&#39;s posts. I&#39;ll also ask Amazon to make corrected versions available to readers who have already purchased, Miri Attwater and All That Glitters&nbsp;as soon as I can get the new copy uploaded. If you want to learn more about fish cleaning stations, here&#39;s a great video to get a good overview of lots of different cleaner fish and their behaviors.
