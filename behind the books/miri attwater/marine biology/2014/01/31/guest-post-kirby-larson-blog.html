Kirby is the author of the beautiful Newbery book, Hattie Big Sky, that won a well deserved Newbery Honor Award in 2007. It&#39;s a story of a pioneer girl in the early 1900s in the style of my favorite Laura Ingalls Wilder book. I&#39;ve given it many times as a gift and highly recommend it as a great read! &nbsp; If you&#39;re curious about a peek into some of how the Miri Attwater series came about, and how a fantasy book came to involve science, you can&nbsp;read my guest blog post at Kirby&#39;s Lane. &nbsp;" />
