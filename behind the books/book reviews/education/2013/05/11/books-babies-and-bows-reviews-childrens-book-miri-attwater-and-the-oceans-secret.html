<meta name="description" content="What does an octopus have to do with mermaids? Read Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#39;s Secret and find out! When I came up with the idea to write a book about a girl who didn&#39;t know she was a mermaid, my intention was to write a book that was pure fantasy. But I discovered something about myself. If I&#39;m creating the magical world, it won&#39;t ring true to me unless it follows the principals of science. I guess that by the time you get a PhD in biology, science is too deeply ingrained in your DNA to deny it. While I had lots of fun researching and imagining all the fantasy science in Miri&#39;s world, there was always that nagging fear in the back of my mind.&nbsp;Is all this fantasy science going to be believable to other scientists? Yes, even someone with a PhD has a fear of looking stupid. :) So I am thrilled about the review just posted at Books, Babies, and Bows! Jenny is a scientist and she gets it! She really gets it! (And she doesn&#39;t think I&#39;m stupid or anything.) From her five star review posted on her blog, Amazon, and Goodreads: What I absolutely love about this book is how the author uses scientific facts to create a rule system for this &quot;magical&quot; world. You learn about how a mermaid changes from legs to fins in a way that makes it believable and magical all in the same breath.&nbsp; Read the rest of Jenny&#39;s review of Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#39;s Secret at Books, Babies, and Bows.&nbsp;And while you&#39;re there, check out her lovely series on 30 books of Kindness. Don&#39;t forget, you can now buy an ebook copy Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#39;s Secret at all of these major retailers.
