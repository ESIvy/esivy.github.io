<meta name="description" content="I&#39;m so excited that What We Do All Day has featured Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#39;s Secret! It&#39;s listed in their post, Mermaid Books and Crafts for Kids. Erica&#39;s son read the book and said, &quot;It was good, even though it was a book for girls.&quot; :) I love that quote! I&#39;ll readily admit that Miri definitely has &quot;girl appeal.&quot; So I think that means the story has to be twice as good for a boy to enjoy it. I find that comment high praise, indeed. What We Do All Day&nbsp;is a great blog written by a mom of two active and intelligent boys, about the books they read and fun activities to fill your summer days.&nbsp;In the post about mermaid books,&nbsp; there&nbsp;are lots of great crafts and other great books. So if you&#39;re looking for some &quot;cool&quot; fun for this summer when you can&#39;t actually get wet or just looking for a great read, head on over and check it out!" />
