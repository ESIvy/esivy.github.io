<meta name="description" content="If you&#39;re hitting the Disney Parks or the Universal Theme parks in Orlando, Florida, you&#39;re going to be doing a lot of walking in the heat. Here are a few things we packed that you might not have thought of. 2 pair comfortable shoes&nbsp;- Wear them on alternate days. Your feet will thank you for it. 2nd pair of comfortable shoes - Did you pay attention when I said 2 pairs of comfortable shoes? Because my kids didn&rsquo;t. :) Insoles - Because at least one pair of shoes isn&rsquo;t going to be as comfortable as you or your kid thought they were. 2 different kinds of socks - wear on alternate days Socks - Different socks, because your kid&#39;s favorite socks aren&rsquo;t always the most protective. Blister protection - Carry this with you. Apply as soon as you notice a rub, before the blister forms. My youngest was really glad I had this when she wore her favorite tiny sock-lets and what turned out to be not-so-comfortable shoes. Bandaids - In case you ignore what I told you about taking the spray with you and someone gets a blister. String backpack - Everyone needs some type of pack. A friend suggested this type for the kids and they were perfect. Everyone carried their own snacks and some water. Divvy up the rest of stuff you&rsquo;re going to carry. Put those teens to work! :) Fanny pack - Because some rides at Universal Studios Parks won&rsquo;t let you take backpacks but they will let you strap on a fanny pack. Make sure at least one of you has one of these. Hat - Soft ones that can take some folding are useful. Sunglasses Umbrella &nbsp;- Not just for rain, your own portable shade! You want one that&rsquo;s not too big or heavy with a carrying loop, that collapses and folds easily. Fan, a personal fan - We liked these with the hanging cords the best. Mist bottle - It&#39;s an uphill battle against the Florida heat and humidity, but we all found this refreshing! The ones by O2 Cool and Orbit were the best. Cooling cloth - We tried 3 types of cooling ties (including the gel type). This one Grabber Magic Cool Bandana Cooling Cloth was by far mine and my husbands favorite, although the kids wouldn&rsquo;t wear them for love or money. Ziploc bags - Take a couple extra, you&rsquo;ll find more uses for these while you&rsquo;re at the parks. One example, keep your phone dry on Splash Mountain. Rain ponchos - Not just for rain, but for wet rides too. I wish my husband had slowed down enough to put these on before Splash Mountain! Spray Sunscreen - If you&#39;re your family&#39;s designated sunscreen police, you&#39;ll get many fewer arguments when you pull out this kind for a quick, cooling spray. Noise cancelling ear buds - Some of the new rides, like Rockin&#39; Roller Coaster, are LOUD. If you&#39;ve got some of these or some ear plugs handy, it might help make the ride more bearable for you or kids that are scared by loud noises. They&#39;d also come in handy for little ones at the fireworks shows!" />
