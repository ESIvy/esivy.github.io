<meta name="description" content="It&#39;s that time of year again! When you ask - Will you be my Valentine? If you can&#39;t get up the courage to ask in person - ask the Magic Conversation Heart Valentine! I came up with this idea and sold it to Family Fun Magazine in 2008. It appeared in the February 2010 issue. They called it the Oracle of Love and modified the directions to cover the jar with air drying clay, which makes the fortune teller look really awesome! I had considered the same idea, but had decided it would be too expensive. My original directions covered the jar with craft foam. The directions are below. Magic Conversation Heart Valentine - A Valentine Craft You will need: 1 small glass jar (Such as a baby food jar &ndash; one with a fairly flat bottom works best.) 1 1-inch Styrofoam ball sheets of &nbsp;craft foam in assorted colors permanent marker low temperature hot glue (or other waterproof glue) permanent double stick tape craft foam stickers (optional) Directions: 1. Using the heel of your hand against a hard surface such as a table, gently press the Styrofoam ball into a cube. 2. Using assorted colors of craft foam, cut out six hearts the size of a face of your Styrofoam cube, approximately &amp;frac34; inch. On each heart, use a permanent marker to write a possible answer to a yes or no question, such as &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; &quot;maybe,&quot; &quot;for sure,&quot; &quot;you bet,&quot; or &quot;no way.&quot; 3. Have an adult use the low temperature hot glue to affix the hearts to each side of the cube. To do this, put a small dot of hot glue on the blank side of a heart, and then carefully press the cube down on top of it. &nbsp;(Tips for using a low temperature hot glue gun: Keep a small bowl of water nearby for cooling hot glue quickly when an accident occurs.) 4. Measure the craft foam to cover the jar. Trace around the lid and cut out a piece to cover the top of the lid. To cover the sides of the jar, measure the height of the jar including the craft foam on top of the lid. Next measure the circumference of the jar. Cut a rectangle of craft foam with the height of the jar and the length of the circumference. 5. Fill the jar with water and float the conversation heart cube inside. Carefully fill the jar as full as you can without it overflowing when you put the top on. Screw down the top tightly. 6. Using permanent double stick tape, affix the craft foam to the jar. Then decorate the jar using permanent markers and craft foam stickers or cut out craft foam shapes. 7. To use, shake the Magic Conversation Heart Valentine as you ask it a question such as &quot;Will you be my Valentine?&quot; Turn the Magic Conversation Heart Valentine over to reveal the answer!
