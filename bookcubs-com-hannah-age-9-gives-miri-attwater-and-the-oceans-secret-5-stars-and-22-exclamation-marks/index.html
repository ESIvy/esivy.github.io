<meta name="description" content="For kid&#39;s books, there&#39;s nothing better than a book review by&nbsp;kids. Here&#39;s what Hannah, age 9, over at BookCubs had to say about Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#39;s Secret. If you like funny fantasy books you&rsquo;ll love this. It is fantastic. If you do not think it is great, you are crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And as a writer, there&#39;s nothing better than a kid&#39;s review like that. :) And yes, all those exclamation points are her&#39;s - I didn&#39;t add any. Her favorite part was Miri&#39;s dinner with the Queen. That makes me happy, because I had fun writing it. (Sneak Peek - there&#39;ll be another fancy dinner with funny dishes in Book 2.) Before I wrote about Miri&#39;s first meal in Kai Kaona, I ate some seaweed salad! It wasn&#39;t too bad. A little rubbery. :) Some of the rest came from memories I have - like when someone advised me to order &quot;seafood&quot; noodles in Japan and it turned out to be &quot;seaweed&quot; noodles. And the time at a fancy restaurant in New Orleans that my grandmother was served a baked fish with its head still on. She was a proper Southern lady, a phenomenal cook, and had cleaned a few fish from my grandfather&#39;s catch in her day. She would never have served a fish head at her table. She sent that fish right back to the kitchen to be properly prepared! What about you - what&#39;s the strangest, most adventurous, thing you&#39;ve ever eaten? Leave a comment and tell us about it!" />
