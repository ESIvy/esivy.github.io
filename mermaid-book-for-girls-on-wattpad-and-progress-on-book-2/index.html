<meta name="description" content="It&#39;s been a while since I made a new post, I know! And have you signed up for my Newsletter? Because I&#39;ve definitely made good on my promise not to fill up your inbox. :) I&#39;ve sent exactly, um, zero newsletters so far. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t love my Newsletter subscribers! In fact there will be special offers soon, I promise. It&#39;s just that it&#39;s another thing with a learning curve. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to set up a sign up list. But how, exactly, do I send out a newsletter in the correct form? That&#39;s something I&#39;ve got to figure out, and for now I&#39;ve been trying to focus all my time on... Completing Book 2! (Okay, that and I may have snuck in a trip to Disney World. But hey, I was thinking of you and Miri! There are lots of mermaids at Disney. There&#39;ll be some related posts later.) But yes, Miri Attwater and All that Glitters is starting the editing process! Which means I already have some things that need some changes. :( But hang tight, Book 2 will be better for it, and ready soon! Meanwhile, I&#39;ve started posting Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#39;s Secret over on Wattpad. I post a chapter or so a week. So, if you haven&#39;t read the Ocean&#39;s Secret yet and you can be patient for the next installment, hop on over to Wattpad and say hello. Happy Reading!" />
