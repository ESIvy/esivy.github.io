Reads4Tweens was started by a mom trying to find good books for her kids. But she also happens to be very qualified to talk about children&#39;s books. She has a degree in children&#39;s literature, she&#39;s taught literature in middle school and high school, and she&#39;s currently a freelance editor. Needless to say, a great review from this caliber of reviewer was especially gratifying. You can see her full review of Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#39;s Secret&nbsp;here." />
