  content: "Oh, I have so much I want to say about this topic. For starters, the high
    school I attended was not even given a ranking because it placed so poorly. Ironically,
    I feel very strongly that the school prepared me for success. The school required
    loads of grit for survival. I learned survival in the hallway. You needed stamina
    to survive. Now, if you looked at our track team, the runners on my track team
    were banded together. We won states. We were diligent. But, we also had coaches
    that inspired this determination. My coach met me every morning all summer long
    and ran with me. In the class, the teachers believed in our growth. Now, I am
    a research faculty at a university.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the main problem is
    the way we define success. Success doesn't mean making a lot of money or necessarily
    getting into the best school. Success isn't necessarily me saying I am faculty
    at a University. Success is finding a passion in life and spending a lifetime
    determined to make a difference in that field. Success is just plain finding happiness
    in life. Just because you can answer a bunch of questions on a test doesn't necessarily
    mean that after ten years doing the same thing at work you will be happy and successful.
    In the teaching I do, I meet a LOT of extremely intelligent students, and a good
    deal of them appear to be completely and utterly uninspired- bored. They are great
    at exams. They can answer any question, but they don't seem inspired to be at
    school. There is no intellectual discourse or philosophical debate. There is no
    learning for the love of learning. If they believe there is not direct correlation
    to what they need to know for what they think they will be doing, I can almost
    see the light turn off. Learning is treated almost as a clinical process of training
    the mind to remember. I travel all over doing guest lectures, and I promise you
    that students that engage me most in debate and conversation, are the ones that
    have grit. \r\n\r\nFor my research, I go to industrial plants to assess occupational
    health. While in those plants, I meet these amazingly passionate people that are
    great at what they do; however in today's terms we would never define that job
    title as successful. These mechanics, technicians, welders, carpenters are not
    only good at what they do, but they also seem happy. Their hands are dirty, and
    their hearts are full. So, this is my long winded way of saying- when my kids
    finally get to high school, I hope they are inspired. I hope they find passion.
    And, I hope that leads them to spend their lives pursuing excellence in that passion."

  content: "It's so interesting that you mention the importance that sports played
    in your high school career- because I have really mixed feelings about high school
    and college sports. It's such a huge part of society that I'm afraid to even touch
    it. :) But I do think there are some benefits to sports; I just wonder if the
    balance has gotten off.\r\n\r\nAnd what you say about passion and how we define
    success - that sounds so much like what I heard in the TED Radio Hour talks. And
    the same about your observation that the kids know how to do well in school but
    not being passionate. That fits with what I've been reading, so I'm really interested
    to hear from a personal perspective further evidence that it's true. I'm afraid
    that the school schedule we've constructed for them - both academics and extra-curricular,
    including sports - doesn't leave them <em>time</em> to find a passion. It's something
    I'm struggling with, given the current circumstances, how can you help a student
    learn achievement and still find balance?"

  content: "I ran in high school and college. I did not run my freshman year of college
    and was miserable mentally and physically. For me, running was a form of meditation
    and stress relief. I also participated in Division 3 athletics,which is a very
    different animal from Division 1 or 2. Our coaches had a clear emphasis on academics,
    and most kids on the cross country team were academic all-American. Even now,
    if I am having a hard time writing a report or figuring out a problem for work,
    I will go out for a run to clear my head. Possibly it is helping kids find an
    activity that helps to provide that balance, whether it is running, soccer, karate,
    or playing a musical instrument. \r\n\r\nRight now, my oldest is only in first
    grade, but we realized that not doing any activities while she is in school is
    optimal for her to the downtime she needs to use her imagination. We were doing
    extra activities in the evening, and it wore on her. We may pick some things up
    this summer, but she is much happier if she has time to just play. She is only
    just a kid after all. I would rather her run outside, getting her hands dirty
    than worrying about more structured activities. However, I am left feeling guilty
    like I am depriving her since her friends are all in tons of activities; which
    their parents say are to prepare them for high school and college."

  content: "I know what you mean about finding an activity for balance - for me in
    college I recognized it was choir, which since I was signed up for a class meant
    I had to attend whether I had a chem test to study for or not. :) \r\n\r\nI think
    it's great that you recognized that the evening activities were wearing on your
    daughter and really paid attention to her needs. And I do know that you're hearing
    that if she isn't in X sport by the time she's 4, then she's already behind! But
    I think the issue here comes down to that comment you made about balance - high
    pressure sports are not a balance. That said, I will admit that I feel like organized
    sports are where all the socializing is going on right now, so it can feel a little
    isolating. On the other hand, it might just be my family's personality no matter
    what we're doing - and one benefit is that our family eats dinner together most
    nights of the week. Our kids notice if we go more than a couple of days without
    all sitting down to the dinner table together and complain, even though they are
    teens and preteens they still like family dinner."

<p><a title="high school rankings" href="http://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/articles/2014/04/22/us-news-releases-2014-best-high-schools-rankings" target="_blank">U.S. News released its 2014 best high schools rankings</a> this week.</p>
<p>You can see if your high school ranked here: <a href="http://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/national-rankings" target="_blank">U.S. News National Rankings Best High Schools.</a></p>
<p>Our own local high school is ranked, and moved up well in the rankings, but what does it mean?<!--more--></p>
<p>According to U.S. News, the rankings are based on&nbsp;<em>"overall student performance on state-mandated assessments, as well as how effectively schools educated their black, Hispanic and economically disadvantaged students. We then used participation in and performance on AP and IB exams to evaluate how well schools prepared students for college-level course work."</em></p>
<p>So basically, the schools are ranked according to how schools perform on standardized tests. Because even AP tests, for all their lofty standards, are still just standardized tests. It also means that it ranks high schools only by how well they prepare students for college, not on how well they prepare students for life, careers, or creating their own jobs. All things I'm thinking about with what I want my kids to get out of their high school experience.</p>
<p>The fact that the ranking is based directly on how the schools performed on AP tests got my attention, because I've really been trying to figure out <a href="http://localhost/?p=1919" target="_blank">if a heavy load of advanced placement courses is the best path to success</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://localhost/?p=1920" target="_blank">if the answer to success is to not take a full load of advanced placement courses.</a></p>
<p>I couldn't help but contrast this to a <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/" target="_blank">TED Radio Hour</a> I recently listened to, that challenges how modern society defines success: <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/10/25/240777690/success" target="_blank">Ted Radio Hour, Success.</a>&nbsp;You can also find the TED Radio Hour on itunes. I listened to it using the app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.itunestoppodcastplayer.app" target="_blank">IPP Podcast</a>&nbsp;on my android phone.&nbsp;In particular it made me think of the points that <a href="https://sites.sas.upenn.edu/duckworth" target="_blank">Angela Duckworth</a> measures success more by "grit." I've encountered her research in my reading about education. It also made me think of&nbsp;the assertion of <a href="http://mikerowe.com/" target="_blank">Mike Rowe</a> from <a href="http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/dirty-jobs" target="_blank">Dirty Jobs</a> that the way we define success means that society is now in dire need to train people with skills.</p>
<p>The way U. S. News ranks high schools doesn't take any of this into account. It seems biased in that after standardized state tests the only criteria used is performance on AP and IB exams. I think, however, that AP exams are much more prevalent. And when you look at the fact that the <a href="https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/home" target="_blank">College Board</a> administers both AP exams and the all-important SAT and PSAT exams, it appears that one company is getting rather an over-sized share of influence on how we're educating our high school students.</p>
<p>While you can find plenty of critics for U.S. News college rankings, their high school rankings don't get much attention. But I found a few references.</p>
<p><a href="http://joannaweiss.net/" target="_blank">Joanna Weiss</a> questions the usefulness of the U.S. News high school rankings in her piece, <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/04/24/ending-high-school-achievement-arms-race/Vp0d1aX4t5scyHhG1knUII/story.html" target="_blank">Redefining Teenage Success.</a></p>
<p>You can find a piece about the meaning of high school rankings in general on <a href="education.com" target="_blank">education.com</a>, <a href="http://www.education.com/magazine/article/High_School_Rankings/" target="_blank">High School rankings, what do they mean?</a></p>
<p>And it looks like a local blog breaks it down in terms of what they know about their local school in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2014/04/23/basis-and-university-high-are-top-us-high-schools-which-means" target="_blank">BASIS and University High Are Top U.S. High Schools, Which Means . . .?</a></p>
<p>And there are some common sense analysis at<a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/education/2014/04/23/surprise-school-for-gifted-kids-is-nations-top-high-school/#22724101=0" target="_blank">&nbsp;Surprise! School for gifted kids is nation&rsquo;s top high school.</a></p>
<p>As for our own local school, I think it's a great high school. But I'm not sure that the number of AP classes the students take is the most important aspect. More on that in future posts...</p>
<p>What do you think? Was your high school in the rankings?</p>
