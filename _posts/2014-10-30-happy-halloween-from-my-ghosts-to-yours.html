  content: The kids were *so* excited that the one I mailed to Family Fun Magazine
    and they used a photo of for the article, was the one that they helped make. The
    one I had is actually a duplicate I made so we could keep one ourselves. But it
    is one that even little kids can easily help with, by helping paint, etc.
