<p>By the third grade all of my kids were going strong with reading. The same might happen for your kids if you can find the right books! If you don't read kids' books for your own entertainment (I do!) you might have trouble coming up with some suggestions for your son. But better than my suggestions, are the suggestions of other girls. Here are 9 of the best books for girls, my daughters' favorite books in third grade.<!--more--></p>
<p>My daughters were pretty advanced readers at this age. Your daughter might not yet be a "reader." Don't worry! That's perfectly okay. Like the previous lists, the books are ordered roughly by reading level. While the books at the bottom of the list tend to be more advanced, the books at the top of the list are easier. And sometimes a child will find a challenging book more interesting, so it's worth trying something anywhere from this list. But also take a look at the books on my list <a href="http://localhost/?p=2847" target="_blank">My daughters' favorite books in 2nd Grade.</a></p>

Her obsession with mapping out it's every changing rooms and halls turns out to be important when the castle is attacked. It's up to Celie to save everyone!</p>

Ivy</a>* - Miri isn't thrilled to find out she's a mermaid princess - she's not a very good swimmer and isn't fond of fish and other slimy things. On top of that, there are&nbsp;sharks in the ocean. The princess part almost makes up for it. Except, wait - do mermaids wear&nbsp;clothes? Miri's got a lot to learn about being a mermaid. *<em>Disclaimer: This is a book I wrote. My sweet daughters firmly insisted that it belonged on the list. And they stoutly maintain that the other mermaid books they've read haven't measured up. I hope Miri Attwater ends up on your daughter's list too! And shhhh! She might just pick up a little bit of science along the way. Mermaids aren't magic; they're mammals.</em></p>

(American Girl) by Lisa Yee</a> - American Girl books take a character from a period of history and show they're every day life adventures. They are well researched and well written. &nbsp;Pick a time period and location that you think would be interesting to explore! It can be fun for you daughter to read about the era her parents grew up in.&nbsp; Ivy, in this book, grew up in the 70s.</p>

But it's a little bit shorter and easier to read; a great place for kids to start. Each chapter is it's own contained story, that young readers also like. And there are great details about pioneer life, such as making maple syrup and butter.</p>
