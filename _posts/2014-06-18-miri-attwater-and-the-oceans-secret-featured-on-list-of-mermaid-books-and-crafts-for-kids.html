  content: There are some other good books on the list! The one of collected folklore
    tales by Mary Pope Osborne is one of the books I read for research for the Miri
    Attwater books.

<p style="color: #000000; text-align: center;">It's listed in their post, <a title="mermaid books" href="http://www.whatdowedoallday.com/2014/06/mermaid-books-crafts-kids.html" target="_blank">Mermaid Books and Crafts for Kids</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000; text-align: left;">Erica's son read the book and said, "It was good, even though it was a book for girls." :) I love that quote!</p>
<p style="color: #000000; text-align: left;">I'll readily admit that Miri definitely has "girl appeal." So I think that means the story has to be twice as good for a boy to enjoy it. I find that comment high praise, indeed.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0f3647;" href="http://www.whatdowedoallday.com/" target="_blank">What We Do All Day</a>&nbsp;is a great blog written by a mom of two active and intelligent boys, about the books they read and fun activities to fill your summer days.&nbsp;In the <a href="http://www.whatdowedoallday.com/2014/06/mermaid-books-crafts-kids.html" target="_blank">post about mermaid books,</a>&nbsp; there&nbsp;are lots of great crafts and other great books.
