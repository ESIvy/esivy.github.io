But wouldn't be much of a book cover without a background, now would it? We decided on a simplified version of <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/underwater_1250x200013-e1349278127252.jpg" target="_blank">the original cover</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1148" alt="Miri Attwater and the Ocean's Secret Book cover design background" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Oceans-Secret-Background-263-x-350.jpg" width="263" height="350" /></p>
