<p>It's been a while since I made a new post, I know!</p>
<p>And have you signed up for my <a title="Newsletter" href="/newsletter/">Newsletter</a>? Because I've definitely made good on my promise not to fill up your inbox. :) I've sent exactly, um, zero newsletters so far.</p>
<p>It's not that I don't love my <a title="Newsletter" href="/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> subscribers! In fact there will be special offers soon, I promise. It's just that it's another thing with a learning curve. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to set up a sign up list. But how, exactly, do I send out a newsletter in the correct form? That's something I've got to figure out, and for now I've been trying to focus all my time on...</p>
<p>Completing Book 2!<!--more--></p>
<p>(Okay, that and I may have snuck in a trip to Disney World. But hey, I was thinking of you and Miri! There are lots of mermaids at Disney. There'll be some related posts later.)</p>

<p>But yes, <span style="color: blue; font-size: large;">Miri Attwater and All that Glitters</span> is starting the editing process!</p>
<p>Which means I already have some things that need some changes. :( But hang tight, Book 2 will be better for it, and ready soon!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I've started posting <a href="http://www.wattpad.com/story/5814158-miri-attwater-and-the-ocean%27s-secret" target="_blank">Miri Attwater and the Ocean's Secret over on Wattpad</a>. I post a chapter or so a week. So, if you haven't read the Ocean's Secret yet and you can be patient for the next installment, hop on over to <a href="http://www.wattpad.com/story/5814158-miri-attwater-and-the-ocean%27s-secret" target="_blank">Wattpad</a> and say hello.</p>
<p>Happy Reading!</p>
