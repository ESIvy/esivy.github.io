<p>Last week I showed you the<a href="/behind-the-books/new-website-new-cover-miri-attwater-oceans-secret/"> first step in the new book cover design for the Miri Attwater series. </a></p>
<p>Of course Miri can't stay black and white. :) Next step, color!<!--more--></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1069" alt="Mir Attwater face" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/miri-color-face-350-x-329-300x282.jpg" width="300" height="282" /></p>
<p>Oops! Something is wrong with this picture... do you know what it is? I didn't even catch it. One of my girls pointed it out.</p>
<p>Hint - one of the colors is wrong.</p>
