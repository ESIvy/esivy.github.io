  content: Thanks for the great list, Erin!  It's an excellent place to look when
    searching for gifts for children in the extended family.  I never thought I'd
    forget what my children liked when they were 5, 7, 9... But I confess, it's all
    a bit of a blur now.

    myself looking for suggestions that I haven't already given to my kids.

<p>There many lists claiming to be lists of the best kids books. Lists of hundreds &mdash; if not thousands&mdash; of kids&rsquo; books that are carefully curated for their &ldquo;literary merit.&rdquo;&nbsp;I'm not a literature expert, just a children's book author &ndash; but most of all a mom &ndash; who loves reading, with a house full of readers.<!--more--></p>
<p>I don't know about you, but when I read those long lists I find myself asking, "Yeah, but are the books really any fun to read?" Because when it comes to reading for kids, that's what I'm most concerned about, fun. <a href="http://localhost/?p=2766" target="_blank">When a kid likes to read &mdash;&nbsp;<em>loves</em> to read &mdash; because it's fun, the rest will follow.</a></p>
<p>And that's why the books on these best kids book lists are what&nbsp;<em>my kids&nbsp;</em>consider the best books.&nbsp;The ones they&rsquo;ve read over and over, remember fondly, and the ones who were a great distraction &mdash; a friend &mdash; in times of need. And that&rsquo;s why there aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;neat numbers.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t add books just to get to 10 or 20 in a list.</p>
<p>Below are the lists I'll be covering in this post series. Links will go live after the posts go live, and you'll be able to use this as a reference list to navigate your way around.</p>
