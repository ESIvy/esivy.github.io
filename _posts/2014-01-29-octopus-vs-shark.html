<p>A young reader got to wondering about who would win in a fight, a shark or a puma?&nbsp;I did tons of research on sharks for the Miri Attwater series, but I don't remember coming across that particular information. But I can't resist a good research topic.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Update: A quick update before we get into the rest of the post:&nbsp;<a title="book reviews for parents" href="http://reads4tweens.com/" target="_blank">reads4tweens.com</a> just published a review of <a title="Miri Attwater and All That Glitters Review" href="http://reads4tweens.com/miri-attwater-and-all-that-glitters/" target="_blank">Miri Attwater and All that Glitters.</a> So if you've been wondering what your child would encounter if they read the book, hop over and check it out!</p>
<p>Now, back to the research on shark vs. puma.</p>
<p>I couldn't find anything specifically about shark vs. puma or even shark vs. lion. But I did find that a lion lost to a crocodile. And one unfortunate bull shark found that he shouldn't have tried to take on a hippo.&nbsp;Given that the encounter would have to happen at the edge of water or in water, I think the outcome would likely be similar to crocodile vs. lion. My money would be on the shark.</p>
<p>The most impressive to me, though, was something I remembered from my original research. Given our last topic was octopus it seems appropriate.</p>
<p>Who would win in shark vs. octopus? Check out the video below, Shark vs. Octopus below. The winner might surprise you.</p>
