<p>If you're a child of the 70's, maybe you remember the "pear salad" your mom made you eat?<!--more--> In my family it was a canned pear half on top of a leaf of iceberg lettuce, garnished with a dollop of mayonnaise - filling the hollowed out core - and sprinkled with cheddar cheese. And we were <em>required</em> to eat the soggy, sweet lettuce leaf <em>AND</em> the heaping spoonful of mayonnaise.&nbsp;Can you imagine? I think in my husbands family the pears were filled with cottage cheese.</p>
<p>But you won't get any fussing out of your kids for these fruit "salads." They'll gobble them up! The ghost and jack o'lantern faces are a bit more healthy as they are made entire out of fruit - canned fruit and dried fruit. The monster faces use chewy candies, but it is Halloween after all!</p>

<h1>Jack O'Lantern Peaches</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>canned peach halves in light syrup or fruit juice</li>
<li>pitted prunes (dried plums)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Jack O'Lantern Peach Directions</h2>
<p>1. Drain the peaches and blot them dry with paper towels. (This helps the face pieces stick better.)<br />
2. Use a rolling pin to flatten two prunes for each jack-o-lantern. Using a small knife, cut out two eyes, a nose, and a mouth and position them on peach halves. Use a small piece as a stem.<br />
3. Refrigerate until serving.</p>

<h1>Pear-half Ghosts</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;canned pear halves in light syrup or fruit juice</li>
<li>raisins</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pear-half Ghost Directions</h2>
<p>1. Drain pear halves and blot dry with paper towels. (This helps the eyes to stick.) Position the halves, cut side down, on a plate so that the smaller end is at the top. Trim the pear half into a ghost shape and cut a scallop along the bottom.<br />
2. Cut a raisin into fourths. Use the tip of a small knife to make small holes in the pear where you want the eyes to be. Push one of the raisin pieces into each hole for an eye.<br />
3. Refrigerate until serving.</p>

<h1>Fruit Monster Faces</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>canned pear and peach halves in light syrup or fruit juice</li>
<li>raisins</li>
<li>pitted prunes (dried plums)</li>
<li>gummy candy (we used &ldquo;gummy&rdquo; Lifesavers and sour fruit strings)</li>
<li>candied cherries</li>
<li>tooth picks, broken into pieces</li>
</ul>
<h2>Monster Fruit Face Directions</h2>
<p>1. Drain the fruit halves and blot dry with paper towels. (This helps the dried fruit and candy stick.) Position the fruit on a plate cut side down.<br />
2. Decorate the faces using pieces of candy and dried fruit. To use the prunes, flatten them first with a rolling pin. Hold the pieces on with toothpicks pieces if needed. (If you use toothpicks, be sure and tell the kids before they eat them.)<br />
3. Refrigerate until serving.</p>
