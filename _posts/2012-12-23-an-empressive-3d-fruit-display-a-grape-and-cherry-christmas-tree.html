    Ha ha! Let's see... if that one was 16 inches tall, and how do you compute the surface area of a cone? Is it 1/3 of a cylinder? Oops. That's volume and I need surface area. So I googled it and oh, my goodness! I have to find the length of the slant height, etc. etc. That is just too much math to do on Christmas Eve. Let's just say that it would take the exact time of forever to stick all the grapes on that tree, and judging from how long it took to eat that many grapes a crowd of about a thousand people to eat all of the grapes. But I think one family of my nieces and nephews alone could take care of all of the cherries! They ate all the ones at our Christmas party last night.

    Last night my daughters made one of these with a 9 inch cone. It took 3 lbs of grapes and a lot less time.

    Merry Christmas!

<p>I made this for Dizzy's 5th grade class party and it was a big hit! <!--more-->It's impressive and not very hard, it just takes a while. Things are a bit busy here and I don't have time to post full directions. But, I'll upload the photos off all the steps. Full directions soon! If you need more help, contact me at esivy@phytapublishing.com and I'll try to answer. Family party here tonight and my daughters are going to be busy making another one of these!</p>
