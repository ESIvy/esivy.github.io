<p>In second grade, readers can really take off. Or not. Don't be worried if your child hasn't turned into a reader yet. Just focus on making fun books available.

But better than my suggestions, are the suggestions of another boy. Here are 8 of the best books for boys, my son's favorite books in second grade.<!--more--></p>
