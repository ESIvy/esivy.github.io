<p>Well, I went and did it. I really did it this time.</p>
<p>I'm now on facebook. (eek!)</p>
<p>A facebook page, to be exact.</p>
<p>I have never, ever been on facebook. (I know, hard to believe.) I have no idea what I'm doing. So if you get a chance, drop by and let me know if I'm doing it all wrong. :)</p>
<p>In other news, I've also got an updated author photo and a new avatar.<!--more--> So you'll see a "new face" associate with me around the web. Dizzy took the photos for me.</p>

<p>I'll be updating this webpage with photos, book covers, here there and everywhere... eventually. But for now you can find my new facebook page here: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/E.S.IvyAuthor">https://www.facebook.com/E.S.IvyAuthor</a></p>
<p>Come by and say hello! And if you'd like to keep up with my book news through facebook, please like my page.</p>
