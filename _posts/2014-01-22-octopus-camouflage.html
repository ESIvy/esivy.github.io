  content: The video on the octopus camouflage is absolutely amazing! I knew octopuses
    could do that, but seeing something like that made me believe, too, that mermaids
    could turn their legs into tails.

  content: I know. It's almost hard to believe that it isn't special effects. Can
    you imagine what it would be like to see in person?

<p>When I first started the Miri books, my intention was to write pure fantasy, with magic and everything. Magic makes things easy. Yeah, I know you have to come up with rules but - need something? Make up a rule and bam, you have something. It's magic!</p>
<p>The problem was, every time I got to the point in the story where Miri's legs magically turned into tails, it just didn't feel right to me. Even though other writers used it - in fact the original myths even used it - it still felt hollow and unbelievable. I mean, how could legs turn into tails?<!--more--></p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>I knew it wasn't "real," but still my brain wanted to understand <em>exactly</em> how that could happen.</p>
<p>And then I saw a video of octopus camouflage.</p>
<p>And I believed.</p>
<p>Watch. And believe. :)</p>
