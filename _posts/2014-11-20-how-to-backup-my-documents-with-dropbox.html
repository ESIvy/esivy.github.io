<p>I&rsquo;d like to backup all of the documents on my computer hard drive to the cloud. For cloud storage I use <a href="https://db.tt/NTJdiGou" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>.</p>
<p>(If you want to set up your backups the same way and you don't have Dropbox yet, if use the link above, or this link to <a href="https://db.tt/NTJdiGou" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>&nbsp;,we both get 500 megabites of free bonus space! Just sign up, and they have a great tutorial to get you started.)</p>
<p>So, if you signed up for Dropbox, you now have a Dropbox folder on your computer. This is where you put all the files you want backed up to Dropbox.</p>
<p>Most programs when you save a file for the first time will automagically find your &ldquo;Documents&rdquo; folder on your hard drive and save things to there. So, naturally, it seems like you should just drag, copy that file into your Dropbox folder. But you can&rsquo;t. <!--more-->Because Microsoft has made your Documents folder some type of special locked up type folder. Here&rsquo;s the work around.</p>
<h1>How to backup My Documents with Dropbox</h1>
<p>1. In your file explorer, go into the files in your Dropbox folder. Make a new folder and name it, something like Dropbox Documents.</p>
<p>2. Right click on the folder, choose copy.</p>
<p>3. In your file explorer, go into your Documents folder on your hard drive, right click, and choose &ldquo;paste shortcut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it!</p>
<p>Now when ever a program prompts you to save into your Documents folder, you&rsquo;ll see the reminder to save it into this folder and it will be backed-up automatically to Dropbox when you&rsquo;re connected to the internet.</p>
<p>(Note: If you do this and then drag all your existing documents into this folder, it might take awhile for all your documents to backup. Like, I really long while. :) So make sure you leave your computer on to give it enough time. I might or might not have had this problem.)</p>
