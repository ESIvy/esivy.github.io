  content: My most adventurous eating was tacos de 'sesos' in Mexico.  I liked them
    until I realized that 'sesos' means 'brain' - then I didn't feel very smart!

<p>For kid's books, there's nothing better than a book review <i>by</i>&nbsp;kids.</p>

<p>Here's what Hannah, age 9, over at <a href="http://www.book-cubs.com/2013/06/24/miri-attwater-and-the-oceans-secret-by-e-s-ivy/" target="_blank">BookCubs</a> had to say about Miri Attwater and the Ocean's Secret.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Century Gothic', AppleGothic, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 22px;"><span style="color: magenta;">If you like funny fantasy books you&rsquo;ll love this. It is fantastic. If you do not think it is great, you are crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<!--more--></span></span></p>
<p>And as a writer, there's nothing better than a kid's review like that. :) And yes, all those exclamation points are her's - I didn't add any.</p>
<p>Her favorite part was Miri's dinner with the Queen. That makes me happy, because I had fun writing it. (Sneak Peek - there'll be another fancy dinner with funny dishes in Book 2.)</p>
<p>Before I wrote about Miri's first meal in Kai Kaona, I ate some seaweed salad! It wasn't too bad. A little rubbery. :) Some of the rest came from memories I have - like when someone advised me to order "seafood" noodles in Japan and it turned out to be "seaweed" noodles.</p>

<p>And the time at a fancy restaurant in New Orleans that my grandmother was served a baked fish with its head still on. She was a proper Southern lady, a phenomenal cook, and had cleaned a few fish from my grandfather's catch in her day. She would never have served a fish head at her table. She sent that fish right back to the kitchen to be properly prepared!</p>
