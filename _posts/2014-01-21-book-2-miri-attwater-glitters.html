<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>As if finding out she's a mermaid isn't shocking enough, now Miri has to spend her summer at the bottom of the ocean!&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>Slimy pets, weird and salty food,...&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>Miri doesn't think she'll ever get used to any of it.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><em>But the mermaid city of Kai Kaona is so beautiful, she's made some special friends, and she's surprisingly good at hulikela, a type of underwater dancing. Then, just as she decides things aren't too bad after all, the coronation crown is stolen. Is she going to be stuck at the bottom of the ocean forever?</em></span></p>
