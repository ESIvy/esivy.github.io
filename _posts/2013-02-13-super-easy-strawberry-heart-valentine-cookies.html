<p>Valentine's Day is fast approaching! I don't know about you, but every year I have plans to channel my inner-Martha Stewart and make heart shaped sugar cookies and decorate them with royal icing. Or maybe <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/354785/pecan-linzer-cookies-cherry-filling" target="_blank">Pecan Linzer Cookies with Cherry Filling</a>! Yes! They are gorgeous and I bet they taste even better. And I'll make my own marshmallows and cut them in the shape of hearts and float them on top of hot-chocolate made with real milk on top of the stove!</p>
<p>Sadly, I disappoint myself often. Sometimes, life just gets in the way. I need to remind myself that it doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing approach!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/stawberry-heart-cookies-sized.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-635" alt="Stawberry Heart Cookies sized" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/stawberry-heart-cookies-sized.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="284" /></a>So, here's an idea for those of you who ran out of time or are always more realistic in your expectations! :) These are super easy. And they have fresh strawberries and so they're healthy. Okay, maybe just healthi-<em>er.<!--more--></em></p>
<p>These are super fast to make. I made it first with the white candy coating, which makes a really pretty smooth base. Then I realized that I could make them healthier by using cream cheese as the base. I only had regular cream cheese on hand, but you could make it even healthier by using the lighter cream cheese (Neufchatel) and low fat vanilla wafers (Nabisco makes a low fat version for Nilla). I didn't add anything to the cream cheese to make it extra quick and easy.</p>
<p>In the picture, the one on top is done with the candy coating. The two lower ones are done with cream cheese.</p>
<h1>Super Easy Strawberry Heart Cookie Recipe</h1>
<h2>Option 1:</h2>
<h3>You will need:</h3>
<p>vanilla wafers<br />
strawberries<br />
softened cream cheese (or Neufchatel cheese)</p>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
<p>1. De-hull the strawberries by using the tip of a small, sharp knife.<br />
(Rather than cutting straight across the top.) Slice the strawberries,<br />
and carefully shape the top of each slice into the top of the heart.<br />
2. "Ice" a vanilla wafer with the softened cream cheese. Place one<br />
strawberry heart on the top.<br />
3. Refrigerate until serving.</p>
<p>(Note that the cookies will soften with time in the refrigerator,<br />
which improves their flavor, but overnight they might get too soft for<br />
little kids to eat easily. To speed prep, prepare the strawberry<br />
hearts ahead of time and refrigerate. Have your cream cheese at room<br />
temperature for easy spreading.)</p>
<h2>Option 2:</h2>
<h3>You will need:</h3>
<p>vanilla wafers<br />
strawberries<br />
white candy coating or white chocolate pieces</p>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
<p>1. De-hull the strawberries by using the tip of a small, sharp knife.<br />
(Rather than cutting straight across the top.) Slice the strawberries,<br />
and carefully shape the top of each slice into the top of the heart.<br />
2. Melt the white candy coating or white chocolate candy pieces in the<br />
microwave just until softened. "Ice" a vanilla wafer with the soft<br />
candy coating. While the coating is till warm, place one strawberry<br />
heart on the top.<br />
3. Refrigerate until serving.</p>
