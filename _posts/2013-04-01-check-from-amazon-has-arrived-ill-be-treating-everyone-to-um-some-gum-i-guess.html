    I was going to ask if that was an April Fools joke. :-)
    On the serious side, congrats! I'm sure even J.K. Rowling's first checks must've been no bigger than that.
    And on Monday we went to the park--which made the kiddos happy, and everybody knows happy kids makes for happy parents!

    I never, ever, ever joke about money. Especially such high amounts.

    :) Hah! I hadn't realized that it came on April 1.

<p>The earnings from Miri Attwater and the Ocean's Secret has finally gotten big enough for Amazon to cut a first check! Woohoo! And it's a whopper, a whole $103.09.</p>
<p>But in publishing you have to celebrate the little successes. And I must say, even getting a small check made me happy today.</p>
<p>What about you, what made you happy today? Happy Monday!</p>
