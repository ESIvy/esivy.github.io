<h1>Ghost Paper Doll Garland Directions</h1>
<p>You will need:<br />
8 &frac12; x 11 inch white paper<br />
scissors<br />
hole punch</p>
<p>1. Fold the short side of the paper up 1 &frac12; inches. Flip the paper over and turn the same edge, the same amount, to the opposite side. Continue<br />
flipping and folding the paper to fold the paper into an accordion, or fan, fold. Trim off the last &frac12; inch.<br />
2. Trace half a ghost onto the folded paper, the arm and hand should reach the opposite side, just like you would for a paperdoll. Cut out the<br />
ghost shape.<br />
3. Use the hole punch to make the eyes of each ghost while they are still folded in half.<br />
4. Unfold and tape together strands made from different sheets of paper to make garlands.</p>
