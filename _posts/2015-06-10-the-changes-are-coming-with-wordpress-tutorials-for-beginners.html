<p><a href="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wordpress-tutorial-esivy-logo-300-x-150.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1626" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wordpress-tutorial-esivy-logo-300-x-150.jpg" alt="Blogging basics - Wordpress tutorial, Wordpress Security Tips" width="300" height="150" /></a>I posted a month or so ago that I had a new URL and the website would be moving, but when you do your own development, things can take awhile. It can take even longer if you're trying to do thing "right."&nbsp;For example, Austin has a very active WordPress community,&nbsp;so earlier this week I attended a WordPress MeetUp about web site security. And I wrote a post, <a href="http://localhost-security-tips/">Wordpress Security Tips for Beginners.</a></p>
<p>During this process, you might notice some things on this blog preparing for the move. If you don't see it already, soon I'll be using the template Foodie Pro with Genesis on this site, just so I can check out how it's going to work. But it won't be completely styled, so a few things might look out of place.</p>
<p>The upside to how thoroughly I'm researching everything, if you happened to design your own website, or want to, I'm working on a pretty extensive series of WordPress tutorials for beginners to the more advanced, on everything from buying your domain, setting up local test sites on your own computer, migrating a designed site to another location and styling Foodie Pro for Genesis into a Lifestyle blog. So be sure to keep up with the changes or sign up to follow my blog in email!</p>
