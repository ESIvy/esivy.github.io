  content: Sweet! This will definitely catch the eye of middle-grade girls. (Although,
    my daughter DID like the bubble castle from the old cover...). All in all, it
    looks awesome!

<p>Now it's time to put it all together! I think you're going to like the new book cover design. The aim was to make the new cover friendlier for younger readers.&nbsp;I must say, TechnoTim does amaze me with his learning of new programs for this project.</p>
<p>Just to remind you, the original cover is this:<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-818" alt="Ocean's Secret cover_1250x2000" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Oceans-Secret-cover_1250x20001-187x300.jpg" width="187" height="300" /></p>
<p>(Hehe. I bet you're thinking that's <em>all</em> over this page, so why am I reposting it? Well, as you can imagine, there are plans for the webpage design to change. One thing at a time!)</p>
<p>So, we took&nbsp;<a href="/behind-the-books/book-cover-design-miri-attwater-oceans-secret-cover-redesign-part-4/">Miri in full color</a><a href="http://www.miriattwater.com/2013/11/miri-attwater-and-oceans-secret-cover.html">,</a>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a title="Book Cover Design: Miri Attwater and the Ocean&rsquo;s Secret Cover Redesign, part 5, background" href="/behind-the-books/book-cover-design-miri-attwater-oceans-secret-cover-redesign-part-5/">background...</a></p>
<p>Oh! And we added a title, of course.</p>
<p>And the author name. That's&nbsp;<i>really</i>&nbsp;important.</p>
<p>So here it is - the brand new cover for Miri Attwater and the Ocean's Secret!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1223" alt="ocean's secret cover 304 x 401" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/oceans-secret-cover-304-x-401.jpg" width="304" height="401" />What do you think?</p>
