So I'm thrilled that <a title="read Books Babies and Bows book review for parents of All That Glitters" href="http://booksbabiesandbows.blogspot.com/2014/01/miri-attwater-and-all-that-glitters-by.html" target="_blank">Books, Babies, and Bows has reviewed Miri Attwater and All that Glitters</a>.</p>

<p>On of the favorite parts for Jenny and her two daughters &nbsp;was the scene where Miri visits a fish cleaning station to remove the algae growing on her skin. They wondered if there really are fish cleaning stations on the ocean. There are! When I first learned about them I was fascinated too. Next week, I'll start a series of posts about fish cleaning stations.</p>
