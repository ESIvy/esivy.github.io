  content: Ah, so it was the eye color! It's looking good! I'm not able to log in
    to my IntenseDebate to moderate comments on my blog, just to let you know why
    yours is not there. I'm still waiting for support to respond to my problem. Have
    a wonderful day!

  content: "Haha! Aren't blogs wonderful? I've got an image intensive post I'm trying
    to write, and Wordpress won't arrange the pictures well at all. So I'm trying
    to find a good lightbox plug-in - I've been looking for carousel and that's apparently
    the wrong term! \r\n\r\nOh, wait! While typing this I had an epiphany - if I just
    center all my pictures it will fix my problem of the text keeping up with the
    images. Face-palm. It won't look quite like I want but it will work!"

<p>So we've got <a href="http://localhost/?p=1109" target="_blank">Miri in full color</a>, with a torso and hands and everything for the new book cover design. But we're not done yet! Next up, some shading so that she wouldn't just be a flat image. And we fixed <a href="http://localhost/?p=1065" target="_blank">that color mistake...<!--more--></a></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1145" alt="Miri Attwater" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/miri-shaded-395-x-350.jpg" width="395" height="350" /></p>
<p>Did you find the color error yet?</p>
