<meta name="description" content="We took our kids &ndash; with our main focus being our son, who&#39;s a high school junior &ndash; to visit two private universities in our state over spring break. While our son is very focused on a major in computer science, I took our daughters to see the fine arts department at one school, and visited with women who are a professor of interior design, a biochemist, and a chemical engineer/turned industrial engineer/turned computer science lecturer/women in engineering adviser, at another. Meanwhile I&#39;ve been reading, a lot. And when my kids have a short moment where they&#39;re not doing homework, I try to squeeze in the chance to impart a small amount of my gained knowledge to them.
