SD card - a memory card like you would use in a digital camera. It looks like a little tiny floppy disk and it&rsquo;s got the same purpose. It feels like it&rsquo;s about the size of your thumbnail, but it&rsquo;d be more accurate to say its approximately 1 inch square.&nbsp;It inserts completely into the computer, flush with the case. You have to use your fingernail to depress it and pop it out.&nbsp;You can see what memory card slots look like on the memory card reader pictured below.

USB port - a port or a socket into which you can plug devices up to your computer, including phones, ebook readers, external disk drives, and external hard disks. You can see both the USB ports and the USB &quot;plug&quot; on the USB hub pictured. Think of it like an extension cord. There&#39;s one &quot;plug&quot; and multiple rectangular &quot;sockets.&quot; But a USB port is even fancier than an electric socket. You can transfer data through it AND you can use it like an electric socket - to charge a device like a phone or ereader. That confused the heck out of me for the longest time! Sometimes flash drives are called USB sticks because they &ldquo;stick into&rdquo; the USB port. Which brings us to...
