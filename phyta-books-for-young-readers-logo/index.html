<p>It's the new logo for Phyta Publishing, Phyta Books for Young readers! And I'm especially proud of it because I not only designed it, but I drew it myself using Inkscape. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape" target="_blank">Inkscape</a>&nbsp;is open source free software.) It was my first experience drawing something in vector graphics.</p>
<p>"Phyta" means plants and makes me think about green plants and growth. Phyta Publishing is all about growing readers!</p>
<p>For the longest time I couldn't figure out why "phyta" was so much more familiar to me than most people. Turns out that "-phyta" is the ending of all the plant division names in biology classification.</p>

<p>It's also often found in other names relating to plants, such as "gametophyte." A "fern gametophyte" is a tiny fern plant that's part of the fern's reproductive cycle. And that just happens to be what&nbsp;I studied, experimented on, and looked at under a microscope by the thousands to earn my PhD in&nbsp;plant biology. It appears that from the "magic" in Miri Attwater that is explained imaginatively by science, to the naming of the publishing company, I just can't get away from my science background!</p>
