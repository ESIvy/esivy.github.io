<meta name="description" content="In this tutorial I&rsquo;m going take you through the steps for backing up Scrivener files (or projects.) You&#39;re going to save your&nbsp;Scrivener files three places. 1. Save your working copies to your computer hard drive. 2. Save the 25 most recent automatic backups to a second location, such as in the cloud. 3. Save an infinite number of manual backups to removable storage, like a memory card. 1. Save your working copies to a location you can find again. When you start a project, be sure you pick a location to save it on your computer where you can find it again. (For more information, see my post&nbsp;Where does Scrivener save files? Scrivener for Windows.) From the toolbar choose File &gt; New Project&hellip; &gt; Blank (or Fiction, etc.) To the right of &ldquo;Where:&rdquo; choose &ldquo;Browse&rdquo; and find where you want to save your Scrivener projects. (I save mine to a folder that&rsquo;s also automatically backed up to the cloud, specifically DropBox. (For more information, see my posts What does storage in the cloud mean?&nbsp;and How to backup My Documents with Dropbox.) 2. Set Scrivener&rsquo;s auto-backup location 1. From the Menu choose Tools&gt;Options 2. In the new window, from the menu on the left choose &ldquo;Backup.&rdquo; 3. Make sure &ldquo;Turn on automatic backups&rdquo; is checked. 4. Make sure &ldquo;Back up on project close&rdquo; is checked. 5. Check &ldquo;Back up with each manual save.&rdquo; 6. Next to &ldquo;Retain backup files:&rdquo; select &ldquo;Only keep 25 most recent backup files&rdquo; from the drop-down menu activated by clicking on the down arrow to the right. (For my reasoning on picking 25 copies, see my more in-depth tutorial,&nbsp;Scrivener - Safely Saving Scrivener Files and Projects Tutorial). 7. Make sure &quot;compress automatic backups as zip files&rdquo; is checked. (This will save you room on your backup disk.) 8. Check &ldquo;Use date in backup files names.&rdquo; This will make it easier to make sense out of your backups files should you need to sort through them. 9. What you have should now look like this: 10. To the right of &ldquo;Backup location&rdquo; click the button that says &ldquo;Choose&hellip;&rdquo;. 11. Browse to find where you want to back up your files, For me, it&rsquo;s a folder I made specifically for Scrivener backups inside the folder that&rsquo;s monitored by Dropbox. (For an explanation of Dropbox and storing &ldquo;in the cloud&rdquo; see my post&nbsp;What does storage in the cloud mean?). You could also choose a removable drive. (For more information, see my post What is a flash drive? Tutorial on removable, external, computer file storage.) 12. Select the location you decided to save to. 13. Click &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; 3. Backup to a removable copy, done manually once a week. This is the backup to a removable memory card, USB stick, or flash drive. (For more information see my post What is a flash drive? Tutorial on removable, external, computer file storage.) This is the backup that I&rsquo;m going to remember to make manually. And since I can just stick in a new memory card when the first one is full, I can keep an infinite number of copies. So if I discover I accidentally deleted the first half of my novel three months ago, I&rsquo;ve still got a copy! 1. Choose File &gt; Back up &gt; Backup to&hellip; 2. On the right, click on the &ldquo;Browse&rdquo; button and find your removable storage device. 3. I leave it with the default of putting the date in the name and I let it zip the files. That&rsquo;s it! I just have to remember to do it&hellip; And now you know the steps for backing up Scrivener files&nbsp;and exactly where Scrivener saves the different types of files. If you need help figuring out how to open an existing Scrivener file now that you&rsquo;ve saved it and know where to find it, see my post on How to open an existing Scrivener for Windows project.
