<meta name="description" content="I&rsquo;ve seen print publishing&rsquo;s answer to ebooks. Many have predicted the end of paper books, that they&#39;ll go the way of the stone tablet. Others have suggested they&#39;ll persist only as expensive collector&#39;s editions - elaborate coffee table books with burnished gold edges. I was lucky enough to attend a book signing at Book People in Austin for Richard Peck&rsquo;s new book, The Mouse with the Question Mark Tail. The future is already here. Richard Peck himself was quite pleased with the design of the book. I think he&#39;s got ebooks to thank for it.&nbsp;For their Newbery Award winner, Penguin has turned out a stunning book. The design starts with foil embossing on the front of the dust jacket and two-tone glossy printing on the back, but even the hard cover itself has a full color illustration. The color continues to the inside, where every page has a touch of blue ink in the page folios and headers. First chapter pages have a two-color illustrations in blue and gray. Every chapter has one or two full page illustrations - and not just in black and white, they&#39;re done in blue. Some of Kelly Murphy&#39;s lively illustrations have interesting perspective. The real surprise, though, is the full color illustrations on glossy paper. The book has 3 of these vibrant pages. It&#39;s not many, but I&rsquo;ve never seen glossy color pages in a middle grade book before. Richard Peck pointed out that it&rsquo;s his first book with full page color illustrations. (And he&#39;s written a lot of books!) It really is a beautiful book. And they&#39;ve done it all at a price in line with other hardcover children&#39;s books, $16.99. Even though I got to Book People early before the talk so that I could connect my laptop to the WiFi for Stacy Abrams&#39; SCBWI webinar on Best Practices in Digital Publishing, it was enough to make me want to buy a print book. So it&#39;s time for me to quit writing this post and get back to trying to figure out how to format Miri Attwater and the Ocean&#39;s Secret for CreateSpace. It won&#39;t be the same as Richard Peck&#39;s book, but it&#39;s a start. And then I&#39;d better do some real writing. Because beautiful printing and illustrations aren&rsquo;t all The Mouse with the Question Mark Tail has going for it. Richard Peck is a master of storytelling. Even his author presentation was a masterful weaving of his inspiration, his life, his writing career, and humor. Readers might pick up the book because of it&rsquo;s beauty, but they&rsquo;ll treasure it for the story. &nbsp;" />
